# Tip Calculator

## *Viktor Nikolov*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Functionality

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on).
* [x] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [x] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [x] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount.

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [x] Custom colors palette selected.
* [x] Added the option to split the bill and tip between a given number of people.
* [x] Added a button that sends you to a second activity.
* [x] Added a second activity that displays the information from the main activity.

**TO DO**
* [ ] The information is currently not saved after pressing the ***SAVE TIP*** button.
* [ ] There is no recycler view added.

## Notes

There weren't that many challenges while building this app but it gave me a lot of ideas and possible things to improve.
